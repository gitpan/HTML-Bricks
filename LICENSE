                         BRICKS SITE BUILDER

                         It's the kick-assest


    Bricks Site Builder enables web-site designers to interactively build 
    web-sites containing not just static HTML, but also dynamic elements
    such as photo-albums that automatically update when new photos are 
    added to the collection.
   
    Perl programmers can also roll their own dynamic components using
    Bricks Site Builder's component interface.

    Bricks requires the Apache web server (www.apache.org), mod_perl 
    (perl.apache.org), and Mason (www.masonhq.com).
