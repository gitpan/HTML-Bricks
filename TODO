Things to do:

- assyslist: new assemblies are listed as 'assembly' instead of 'assemblynnn'
- unknown: print name of missing brick on label
- httpd.conf: shouldn't have to change default to text/html from text/plain
- table: Review unsplit.  Make changes as needed (current method kind-of makes sense).
- photoalbumset: remove hacks to make pmcdermott.com website look good
- add native perl bricks (/bricks/standard/perl/*) and move column and table to 
  native perl.  (should improve speed)
- Cache component output in the data structure so that Bricks doesn't spend so m
  much time executing code that outputs the same thing every time.

Long-term things to do:

- Write a manual.  Have it accessible via a 'help' button from the authorbar
- Get Bricks to work under CGI
- Add a system configuration API and system configuration manager so that 
  the behavior of Bricks Site Builder and installed sub-systems can be changed  
  via HTML forms when logged in.
- Add a user administraton system so that sub-systems can be built around users
  logging into an account.
- Add a system logging API and analysis tools (try not to reinvent the wheel too much)
- Add internationalization (i18n) and localization (l8n) support
- Add a staging/release functionality so that changes aren't immediately visible to 
  people using the site
- Add a backup/restore functionality 
- Add file-locking to file IO operations
- Come up with a system for brick to brick communication (possibly using brick id's).
- Allow bricks to set a visible error flag so that users know to 'edit' them when 
  there's a problem (directory no longer exists, etc.)
